### Removed

- All Geared up Derivative - As great as this mod is. I only ever used it for Dual Sheathe. Plus it patches Skeletons and I have reasons to believe this is the cause of all the skeleton crashes

### Custom Tweaks and Fixes

- Adjusted dragon priest leveled list to carry forward SAFO's changes
- Adjusted various summermyst leveled lists, summermyst enchantments should show up more now
- Adjusted Weapon Lists of Guards to accomodate for Animated Armoury
